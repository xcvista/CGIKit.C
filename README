CGIKit - A new Objective-C web development concept.

CGIKit is a simple library to develop simple yet strong Objective-C CGI web
applications.

0 History on Objective and web development.

Just to mention, the first ever web browser is written in Objective-C.

Well before this project ever started, there was a properitary product that NeXT
& Apple maintained, called WebObjects. That framework was a good tool to design
and deploy Objective-C based web apps. Sadly Apple decided to port the entire
project to Java, leaving Objective-C out of the world of web development.

1 Aim of this project

This project is to create a set of simple objects to allow writing CGI web apps
in Objective-C.

However this project is not a drop-in replace of legacy WebObjects 4.5. Instead
it is a new, significantly simpler design concept borrowed from ASP.net (where I
personally shifted from before picking up Objective-C.)

2 Principle design

There will be and only be 3 principle classes: CGIApplication, CGIRequest and
CGIResponse.

CGIApplication is just like NSApplication for desktop Cocoa apps, but with a
simpler lifecycle due to the nature of CGI.

CGIRequest holds the request data and CGIResponse holds the response data
respectively.

3 Out of Mac

These classes are intended to compile and work with GNUstep on Linux boxes.
However there is a big to-do since my personal attempts crashed, once & again.
